    "You did an amazing job with this!",
    "I really appreciate everything you've done.",

    "Oh my gosh, you won't believe what just happened!",
    "Quick, we need to act now!",
    "This is so exciting, I can barely contain myself!",
    "Let's go, let's go, let's go!",
    "I suppose we could consider that option.",
    "There's no rush, take your time.",
    "I'm just sitting here, thinking.",
    "Everything is fine, nothing to worry about."
